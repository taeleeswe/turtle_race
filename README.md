# Turtle Race Project

This project simulates a turtle race where six turtles of different colors compete against each other.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the `turtle_race.py` file using Python:

    ```bash
    python turtle_race.py
    ```

5. Follow the instructions to make your bet on which turtle will win the race.

## How it Works

- The project uses the Turtle module in Python to create a graphical interface for the race.
- Six turtles of different colors are created and placed at the starting line.
- Users are prompted to make a bet on which turtle will win the race by entering a color.
- Once a bet is placed, the race begins.
- Turtles move forward randomly with each iteration of the race loop until one of them crosses the finish line.
- The program then determines the winner and displays the result.
